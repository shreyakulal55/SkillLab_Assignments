        The immense sacrifices that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi made for
        India earned him the title of “Father of the Nation”; he was
        born on October 2, 1869. Along with inspiring numerous other
        independence movements and human rights movements around the
        world, he not only helped lead India to independence but also
        played a significant role in its victory. India is recognized
        for embracing the concept of nonviolence thanks to Gandhi,
        popularly known as Bapu. He thought that nonviolent resistance
        and an unwillingness to cooperate with the British would be
        enough to bring about independence.
